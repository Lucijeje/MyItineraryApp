{"name":"Emerald Waters of Lago di Braies","text":"What an incredible first day of hiking! The journey to Lago di Braies exceeded all expectations. The emerald green water was absolutely stunning, reflecting the surrounding mountains perfectly. We arrived early to avoid the crowds and had the place almost to ourselves for the first hour.\n\nThe hike itself was moderate but rewarding. The trail winds through pine forests before opening up to reveal the lake. We spent hours just sitting by the water, taking photos, and enjoying the peaceful atmosphere. The weather was perfect - clear blue skies with just a few wispy clouds.\n\nAfter the lake, we explored some of the surrounding trails and found a beautiful spot for lunch with panoramic views. The fresh mountain air and the sense of accomplishment made this one of the best days I've had in a long time. Can't wait for tomorrow's adventure to Tre Cime!","dayPlanId":"81e91e7211aa3c25dbdc74bd87b0c9f5","itineraryId":"058f32edf35aca065a7d97a027d6243e","date":"16.06.2024","dayOfWeek":"Sunday","id":"45c500903d1af77eeb28fee316d41cd5"}
